# gloomhavenDatabase
Monster stats are in the Creature Stats
Monster AI Decks are in Creature Deck

If you're not sure about what type the database element is, just reference the cs file. If it's not in there or you're still not sure, send me a message on facebook. 

STAY OUT OF THE SPOILER FOLDER. 
- Unless you finished the game or you don't care about it, then you can go in. 
- Don't change stuff unless you've specifically had instructions to do so from me. 

You can use the database to acquire your information quicker. I got it from gloomy companion. 

Thanks,

Donald.
